How do we know if two systems - biological or artificial - process information in a similar way? Similarity measures such as linear regression, Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), Normalized Bures Similarity (NBS), and angular Procrustes distance are often used to quantify this similarity. However, it is currently unclear what drives high similarity scores and what constitutes a good score. Here, we introduce a novel tool to investigate these questions by differentiating through similarity measures to directly maximize the score.
