Hi, I’m Nathan! I’m a PhD student at MIT Brain and Cognitive Sciences. I'm generally interested in rapid learning and systematic generalization in brains and machines. I completed my master's in Applied Mathematics and Physics at UCLouvain in Belgium. I worked as a research assistant in the lab of Robert Yang at MIT, where I developed a pipeline to scale up the evaluation of Recurrent Neural Network models using quantitative similarity measures. I also had the chance to work in the lab of Omri Barak at the Technion. Besides my scientific work, I like building software to try to make scientific modelling more scalable and accessible.
