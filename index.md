Hi, I'm Nathan! I'm a PhD student at MIT Brain and Cognitive Sciences. I studied Applied Mathematics and Physics at UCLouvain in Belgium. After my masters, I worked as a research assistant in the lab of Robert Yang at MIT, and then in the lab of Omri Barak at the Technion. I'm generally interested in understanding the link between dynamics and cognition in the brain. I'm also interested in building software to make scientific modelling more scalable and more accessible.
